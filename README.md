# HOTH 2018 ML Workshop
This is a beginner-friendly workshop on using logistic regression to classify images of dogs and cats. This workshop is based off of the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) course on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng. We highly recommend taking this course if you want to learn more about machine learning.
